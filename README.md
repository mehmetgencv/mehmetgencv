### Hey there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I am Mehmet. I love to stay abreast of the latest trends in the technology world. I had been reading about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) for quite some time now. I am aware of the importance of AI in our future. The concept that intrigues me most about AI is computer vision. Therefore, I aspire to contribute to the development of object detection systems. To achieve that, I believe that I need to extend my knowledge beyond the basic techniques, and that is where the specialization in Computation in Neural and Artificial Systems. AI and ML  are courses that excite me most. I aim to continue the research and enrich myself in the same field to earn a Ph.D. and study robot decisions in diverse social settings, before moving again to the industry as an expert.
